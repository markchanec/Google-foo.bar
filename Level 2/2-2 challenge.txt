Given a list of distinct positive integers named pegs representing the location of each peg along the support beam, 
write a function solution(pegs) which, if there is a solution, returns a list of two positive integers a and b 
representing the numerator and denominator of the first gear's radius in its simplest form in order to achieve the 
goal above, such that radius = a/b. The ratio a/b should be greater than or equal to 1. Not all support configurations 
will necessarily be capable of creating the proper rotation ratio, so if the task is impossible, the function 
solution(pegs) should return the list [-1, -1].

if the pegs are placed at [4, 30, 50], then the first gear could have a radius of 12, the second gear could this case, pegs would be [4, 30, 50] and solution(pegs) should return [12, 1].

The list pegs will be given sorted in ascending order and will contain at least 2 and no more than 20 distinct positive 
integers, all between 1 and 10000 inclusive.
